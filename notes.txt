Problem: no default time to live in redis, how do we set one?
how do we get default exp from main router func (where default time is a param) into the dsCache func?
we have dsCache defined in cache.ts and imported into schema.ts and the schema imported into routes.ts
how do we get scope accessible with those two imports?

can the user pass redisClient into dsCache func somehow so the time option is accessible in scope yet,
we still have the function itself returned to be used in the resolvers? Can we export the client from within another function? (probably not)
